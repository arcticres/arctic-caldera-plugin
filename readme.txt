Send data from Caldera Forms to Arctic Reservations, creating either person or inquiry records.

== Description ==

This is a plugin processor for Caldera Forms that allows sending form information to an installation
of [Arctic Reservations](http://www.arcticreservations.com) using the Arctic API. The plugin currently
supports two processors:

1. Creating a person record
2. Creating an inquiry record

The processors support most built-in fields, as well as all custom fields.

In the case of error or failure, the plugin will still allow Caldera Forms to save the entries and
will then attempt to email the site administrator to warn them about the failure.

This plugin is on GitHub:

https://github.com/arcticres/arctic-caldera-plugin

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress Plugins Installer or upload `arctic-caldera-forms` folder
   to the wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Upload a `arctic-auth.php` file into the plugin directory with your API credentials (for security
   reasons, the API credentials can not be managed through WordPress directly at this time).
3. Activate the plugin from the "Plugins" page.

== Usage ==

See the first screenshot below for an illustration of these steps:

1. Create or edit a Caldera form, and go to the "Processors" tab.
2. Click "Add Processor".
3. Select one of the two Arctic processors (one creates a person record, one creates an inquiry
   record). Most likely, you will want to use both, to create both a person record and a
   corresponding inquiry record. In this case, add the "Person" one first (otherwise Arctic will
   not know who to associate the inquiry with).
4. Once added, you will see a list of the built-in and custom fields from your Arctic installation.
   You will use the "magic tags" to embed specific entries from the form into each corresponding
   Arctic field.
